# Row

The `Row` component is a foundational layout element designed to arrange content horizontally. It is intended primarily to contain `Column` components, which manage responsive behavior via props like `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, and `xls`. Use `Row` to control spacing, alignment, and overall grid structure in your layout.

# Row Component Documentation

The `Row` component serves as the main container in a grid system. Its primary role is to organize and space out its child components—ideally, `Column` components—to create a consistent, responsive layout.

**Key Points:**
- **Layout Container:** Provides a horizontal structure for content.
- **Responsive Design:** Meant to host `Column` components that adjust based on viewport size.
- **Spacing & Alignment:** Manages gaps and alignment to maintain design consistency.

Listed below are additional variations of the component.
