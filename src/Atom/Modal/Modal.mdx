<Meta of={meta} />

The `Modal` component displays content in a layered overlay that requires user interaction before they can return to the main content. It is often used for alerts, forms, or additional information.


<Primary />

<Controls />

## Best Practices

- Use modals sparingly and only for content that requires user attention.
- Ensure that the modal's purpose is clear and that it provides a straightforward way to complete tasks or dismiss information.
- Consider using a confirmation dialog for actions that could result in data loss or other significant changes.
