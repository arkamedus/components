# Tabs

The **Tabs** component is used to switch between different views or sections of content within the same context. It allows users to navigate between related content without leaving the page.

<Primary />

<Controls />

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Content**: Only the content of the active tab is displayed, which helps in reducing clutter and improving user experience.
- **Customizable Orientation**: Supports both horizontal and vertical layouts to fit different design needs.
- **Controlled and Uncontrolled Modes**: Can be used as a controlled component with `activeKey` or as an uncontrolled component with `defaultActiveKey`.
